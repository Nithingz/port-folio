					<p>Hi my name is Nithin Zacharia.I feel like the world is growing darker as each day passes and this worries me. It is my responsibility to change things if I have an ability to do so. We have been creating, designing and manufacturing everything in a perpetually destructive way producing residues and byproducts that are potentially detrimental. Nature and evolution have been overlooked ever since the age of industrialization. Mother Nature has been showing us how to create things, utilize all byproducts efficiently and cleanly and to co-exist with all the ecological spheres in perfect balance and harmony. I wish to observe and study nature, to use those insights into merging biology, technology, design and engineering to preserve, optimize and humanize future. As Chomsky said 
					“If you assume that there is no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, that there are opportunities to change things, then there is a possibility that you can contribute to making a better world”
					It started with hope, all I need now is that opportunity to save and nature my planet to its original balance without hindering Moore’s law or any technological advancements, to create self-sustaining ecosystems that echoes nature. PS: Thats Dre</p>
